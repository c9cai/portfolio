                                <h2>MMS Restful Android App</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">2016 Summer project I worked on during my internship at Sansay.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app_main.png" alt="">
                                <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
                                <p> The objective of the project was to develop a mobile application that could pull information from their     existing MMS (database monitoring) interface. Previously, every web application was run off of SOAP ws, but we ran into a few problems, and proceeded
                                    to try out RESTful ws instead.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app1.png" alt="">
                                <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                <h3>DATA ANALYSIS</h3>
                                <p> The data that we wanted to retrieve was stored in various SQL tables. I compiled a list of
                                    the ones that I needed and created a new class to organize and store all of them.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app2.png" alt="">
                                <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                <h3>CLIENT SERVER INTERACTION</h3>
                                <p> The primary client server interaction would work as follows: The client would first initiate
                                    an https connection with the server, using the ClientKeystore file to authenticate. After a
                                    secure connection is achieved, depending on user input, the client will send a get request
                                    with the specified parameters, which will be processed by the correct resource file on the server
                                    side. The server will use custom SQL queries to populate the android data object, and then
                                    send a reply back to the client. This reply will then be parsed and charted.</p>

                                <h3>ACTIVITIES</h3>
                                <p> Now that I had the backend done, I had to work on the front end portion of the app. The first
                                    thing I had to understand was how activities worked on Android Applications.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p> An activity represents a single screen with a user interface. Each activity has a java file for backend logic, and a xml file to define on screen items(views) in the activity.  In addition, each activity has some methods that must be overridden, onCreate(), on onPause(), etc, that correspond to different parts of the activity lifecycle: </p>
                                 <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app4.png" alt="">
                                 <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                 <h3>INTENTS</h3>
                                 <p> Another important concept I had to learn was Intents. To summarize,  Intents are used to start another activity from within a current one. Intents can be explicit or implicit.
                                Explicit intents are used to start a specific activity (used in this android app) by specifying the class name in the constructor
                                Implicit intents are used to start a type of activity or function, i.e display a web page or show a location on google maps.
                                Each intent can also have “Extras” which essentially act as a key to value Map in order to pass objects/information between activities.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app5.png" alt="">
                                <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                <h3>USER INTERFACE</h3>
                                 <p> Now that I had learned the underlying processes of Android apps, the last step was implementing UI. Each on screen item is called a View - an object that draws something on the screen that the user can interact with. These are contained a ViewGroups, which hold other View/ViewGroups to define the layout.
                                Views can be buttons, textViews, listViews, etc, and need to be defined in the Activity’s xml file. To populate/interact with the views, they are inflated (findViewById method, identified by android:id in xml doc) from the Activities java file, and then built in methods can be used to set Text, or update other properties.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app6.png" alt="">
                                <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                <h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
                                <p> Now, putting it all together. First off, the login screen, where the user selects which system they
                                    want to moniter, and logs in.</p>
                                <br>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app7.png" alt="">
                                <p> Then, in that system, they select which SBC they want to get data from.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app8.png" alt="">
                                <p> Finally, the data should be charted. (No actual data was available, so this is sample data using
                                    the same charting library that was used for the App - MPAndroidChart)</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/projects/app9.png" alt="">
                                                          
                                <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-dismiss="modal"><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Close Project</button>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/mm4.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>During my junior year, I joined the IEEE club to get some embedded programming experience. As a
                                computer science major, I only dealt with high level languages so far. Out of the many projects to choose from
                                I thought micromouse looked the most interesting. I was placed in a team with 4 other students, all different majors, and our objective was to build an autonomous, self learning car or "mouse" that would be able to find it's way through a maze. During this time, I learned a lot about low level arduino code, and gained experience
                                working in team with different majors.</p>

                                <p>As the cs major of the group, I was responsible for the high level algorithm design, such as the 
                                    PID controller code, maze traversal algorithm, and optimization. Below is an example of one of the
                                    things I worked on: the flood-fill algorithm that was used for maze traversal.</p>

                                <p>It was really cool to see everyone contribute their own specialty, like the Mechanical engineering major
                                    design the CAD.</p>

                                <p>Although we didn't place or anything, this was a great experience, and seeing our finished product at the end
                                    was extremely satisfying.</p>

                                    music streaming service they used. Here are some of the questions we asked:</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/cosg3.png" alt="">
                                <p>What we found out from these interviews was that most people liked using Spotify and Soundcloud the most,
                                    with spotify being the most popular. This seemed to be due to a combination of simplicity and utility. Out of all the apps, spotify had the best utility to find new songs for users to add to their playlists, which was a big plus. Following our interviews, we developed a few user scenarios based on responses we received. </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Creating a playlist for the gym.</li>
                                    <li>Organizing playlist based on recently added.</li>
                                    <li>Viewing friend's playlists to find what they're listening to.</li>
                                    <li>Creating a playlist from an artist's album.</li>
                                    <li>Creating a playlist for a party</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>COMPETETIVE ANALYSIS</H3>
                                <p>In order to better understand music streaming apps do worse or better than their peers, we
                                    performed a competetive analysis between 3 of the biggest apps: Soundcloud, Spotify, and Apple Music. Here's an example of a comparison that we didn between Spotify and SoundCloud regarding the ability to organize music on your playlist. (e.g by date,artist...)</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/cogs4.png" alt="">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/cogs5.png" alt="">
                                <p>After performing 9 of these, we had a good idea of what we liked and didn't like about each app.</p>
                                <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                <h3>CREATING SITEMAPS</H3>
                                <p>The next step was to create sitemaps of the 3 different services, in order to see
                                    the different layouts of the apps, and see what was similar and what was different. By isolating and
                                    visualizing these differences, it became a lot more apparant what was working well and what wasn't. Here's the competetive analysis we did of SoundCloud.</p>

                                <p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                                <h3>WIREFRAME REDESIGN</H3>
                                <p>The last step was actually redesigning the music app into a wireframe, which we did using a combination of
                                    Invision and Sketch. Here are some of the main changes we implemented.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/cogs7.png" alt="">
                                <p>Out of all of the different kinds of home pages, we definitely liked SoundClouds the most, because it didn't
                                    overwhelm the user with so many different suggestions, but instead had a friend feed, kind of like Facebook for music. We felt that Apple Music and Spotify's home page functionality could be implemented in the Browse tab, so we based our Home tab off of SoundCloud's.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/cogs8.png" alt="">
                                 <p>Out of all of the Browse options, most people reported that they liked Spotify's the most. However, when we followed up by asking how many of those options people actually used, most people reported that they only looked at the popular playlists. We felt like we could optimize the Browse tab by combining it with single
                                 song suggestions, like SoundCloud's discover feature. That way there would be a good middle ground between having too much, too broad of a suggestion category, and too narrow of one.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/cogs9.png" alt="">
                                <p>Another tab that we changed was the home Tab. Our's is roughly the same as Spotify's but we moved the user profile with followers/following to the front. We want to remind the user that music is a social thing, and to
                                    suggest that they look at what their friends or followers are listening to occasionally.</p>
